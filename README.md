# UQ_methods
Notebooks and Scripts for Uncertainty Quantification in ML models

Each of the .ipynb files in the ```notebooks``` folder walks you through one application of a UQ method and leverages some pre-written functions from ```Utility_Scripts``` to do so.

There are three primary methods that these notebooks explore:
1. Ensemble methods
2. PyMC3
3. Tensorflow probability
