# UQ_methods
Notebooks and Scripts for Uncertainty Quantification in ML models

Each of the .ipynb files in the ```notebooks``` folder walks you through one application of a UQ method and leverages some pre-written functions from ```Utility_Scripts``` to do so.



There are six primary methods that these notebooks explore (along with some WIPs):
0. Ensemble methods
1. Training on Uncertainty
2. PyMC3 metthods
3. Tensorflow Probability (Regression) (WIP)
4. Tensorflow Probability (Classification) (WIP)
5. Using Dropout in NNs
